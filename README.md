## Family Chore & Rewards App

A lightweight React application for managing family chores, rewarding kids, and tracking progressâ€”all stored locally in the browser. The app offers different experiences for Parents and Children, making it easy for families to stay organized and motivated.

## Overview

This app is designed to help families manage household tasks and reward children for completing their chores. It leverages localStorage to persist user data, chores, and rewards. Users can sign up, log in, and set up their profiles as either a Parent or a Child. Parents can assign chores, manage rewards, and track the progress of their children, while children can view their assigned chores, see their earned points, and redeem rewards.

## Features

  - **Add Chore:** Parents can add new chores with details such as description, points, due date, and assignment to a child.

- **Theming**
  - **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes, with the setting saved in localStorage for a consistent user experience.
